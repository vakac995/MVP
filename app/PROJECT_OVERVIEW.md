## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS, Radix UI
- **Routing:** React Router
- **API:** Auto-generated SDK from solarapp.dev (OpenAPI)
- **State & Auth:** Custom hooks, React Context, OAuth2

---

## Project Structure
- `src/main.tsx` — App entry point, sets up providers and routing
- `src/components/` — Feature and UI components
- `src/components/pages/` — Main app pages (Home, Projects, Forum, etc.)
- `src/components/layout/` — Layout components (Header, AppLayout, etc.)
- `src/components/ui/` — Reusable UI primitives (buttons, cards, dialogs, etc.)
- `src/auth/` — Authentication context and logic
- `src/hooks/` — Custom React hooks (auth, toast, etc.)
- `src/lib/sdk/` — Auto-generated API client and types
- `src/types/` — Custom TypeScript types

---

## App Initialization
- The app is bootstrapped in `src/main.tsx`.
- Sets up the API client, authentication provider, error boundaries, and router.
- Renders the root React component into the DOM.

---

## Routing & Layout
- **Router:** All routes are defined in `src/components/Router.tsx` using React Router v6+.
- **Layout:** `AppLayout` provides a persistent header, main content area, and mobile navigation.
- **Protected Routes:** Some pages (Profile, Create/Edit Project) require authentication.
- **Fallback:** Unknown routes redirect to Home.

---

## Authentication
- Managed by `src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` and `src/hooks/use-auth.ts`.
- OAuth2 login, token management, and user context.
- `<SignedIn>` and `<SignedOut>` wrappers for conditional rendering.
- User details panel shown when logged in.

---

## Pages & Features
- **HomePage:** Featured projects, recent activity, donations, comments.
- **ProjectsPage:** List, search, and filter projects by category.
- **ProjectDetailPage:** Project info, timeline, comments, voting, donations, sharing.
- **ForumPage:** Timeline and project discussions.
- **ProfilePage:** User’s projects, votes, donations, comments, badges.
- **Create/Edit Project:** Forms for submitting or editing projects.
- **RegistrationPage:** User registration and onboarding.
- **SearchPage:** Search across projects and comments.
- **ThreadPage:** View and comment on timeline items.
- **AboutPage:** App features and community info.

---

## UI Components
- **`src/components/ui/`**: Reusable UI primitives (buttons, cards, dialogs, etc.), built with Radix UI and TailwindCSS.
- **`src/components/badge/`**: Badge display and showcase for gamification.
- **`src/components/components/`**: Comment section, donation dialog, share dialog, etc.

---

## API & Data Layer
- **`src/lib/sdk/`**: Auto-generated API client and types from solarapp.dev’s OpenAPI spec.
- All data fetching and mutations (projects, votes, donations, comments, badges, registration, etc.) are done via these SDK functions.

---

## Types
- **`src/types/`**: Custom TypeScript types, e.g., for user details.

---

## Gamification & Other Features
- **Badges:** Earned for user actions, shown in profile and on registration.
- **Toasts:** Feedback for user actions.
- **Mobile Support:** Responsive layouts and navigation.
- **Error Boundaries:** Graceful error handling for React views.

---

## Customization
- You can extend or override most of the app’s logic by editing the React components and hooks.
- The codebase is modular, readable, and ready for further development.

---

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Start the dev server: `pnpm run dev`
3. Open the app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
